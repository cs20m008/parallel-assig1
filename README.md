INTRODUCTION-
what is the problem with sparsity:-
1. in sparse matrix lot of storage space is wasted.
2. during matrix multiplication we are working on all the elements,when we know max. are zero ,so we are wasting lot of time also.

1st method=
1. i have taken two matrix and stored them in dense format.
2. i have then calculated the matrix multiplication of the two matrix taken in the dense format.
3. and calculated the time taken by this multiplication.

2nd method=
1. in 2nd  method i have stored both the matrices in the unordered map format.
2. and then calculated multiplication of both the unordered map.
3. and calculated the time taken by this matrix.
